Over the past 20 years, more than 8,50,000 people have died in one or another disaster in the Asia Pacific region.
Seven of the world's top 10 countries in terms of the number of deaths from disasters are in the Asia Pacific region.
It's really hard to see people affected in a disaster suffer.
But I was inspired by his courage, perseverance, and passion to overcome any adversity and start afresh.
In my experience, the more we trust people's own leadership, the better the outcome.
We need such initiatives and support through policies and mechanisms.
Since the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, the five most affected nations have enacted new laws for disaster prevention management.
In a day or two, we will celebrate the first International Tsunami Awareness Day.
The same goes for improving cyclone forecasting.
In India, if we compare the impact of cyclones in 1999 and 2013, we can see the progress made.
The program is now globally recognized and internationally recognized.
There are still many big challenges ahead of us.
If we do not manage growth effectively, both in terms of planning and implementation, the economic and human loss from disasters will be greater than ever before.
In this context, I would like to present to you a ten-point agenda to take a fresh look at our efforts at disaster prevention and risk reduction:
First, all sectors related to the development process must adhere to the principles of disaster management.
In the next one to two decades, most of the new infrastructure in the world will come up in our region.
We need to ensure that it is built to the best available standards of disaster prevention and safety.
India will work with other partner countries and all parties involved should partner to promote a robust disaster response infrastructure in the region or build a centre.
Currently, in most countries in the region, access to insurance is limited to middle and upper-middle income groups.
The Jan Dhan Yojana has brought millions of people into the banking system.
A protection insurance plan provides insurance coverage to millions of people who need this coverage the most.
They also possess special abilities and acumen.
Fourth, investments should be made in technology that detects risk factors.
We have widely accepted standards and criteria for assessing the risk associated with a natural disaster such as an earthquake.
As part of this network, individual universities may conduct research in more than one discipline on the disaster prevention issues that are most relevant to them.
Social media has changed the way we respond to disasters.
It enables disaster response agencies to work faster, more efficiently, and connect citizens more easily with authorities.
After a tragedy occurs, affected people use social media to help each other.
Specific actions have to be planned and implemented at the local level.
For example, the local fire service visits a school in their area every week and over the course of a year will provide thousands of children with information on what to do when a fire breaks out.
And lastly, there is a need to establish greater coherence in responding internationally to disaster prevention.
After a disaster, there is a massive outpouring of aid from all over the world to those affected by the disaster.
All nations in the Asia-Pacific region must work together to advance our efforts to build robust disaster resilience.
Regional and international cooperation provides an important impetus to our efforts.
In November last year, India hosted the first-ever South Asian Annual Disaster Management Exercise.
In keeping with the spirit of regional cooperation, India will soon launch the South Asia Satellite.
As we implement the Sendai Framework, we will welcome new opportunities for regional and international engagement.
"The government is constantly working to create a conducive environment for business in the country," the Prime Minister added.
Due to such efforts, India\'s rank in the World Bank\'s Ease of Doing Business ranking has improved significantly from 142 to 77. "
"We are constantly striving to make the process of doing business easier for small entrepreneurs," the Prime Minister added.
We give loans up to Rs. 1 crore in 59 minutes. "
I thanked every party that day as well.
When all the parties work together in the interest of the country, decisions are also made well, quickly, and the results are also good.
The expectations and needs of the common citizen will be discussed.
There will also be a discussion on what the government is thinking and I think a very good discussion will also take place in the session.
I am happy to join this distinguished gathering of international leaders and decision-makers from the food processing sector.
India is also the largest producer of milk in the world.
Our trade with Europe and South-East Asia through the pepper route is very famous.

It is now easier than ever to start a new business in India.

The Council was established 50 years ago and during this period, India has made strides in the gems and jewellery industry.
Until recently, Indian importers had to go abroad to see and buy rough diamonds.

It is yielding good results.
Earlier, 80 to 90 big traders used to travel to Belgium, Africa and Israel to see and buy global rough diamonds.
At present, about 3,000 small and medium traders get this facility through the new Special Notified Zones.
Skill India aims to ensure that the new entrants to the workforce are equipped with the necessary skills to contribute to the 21st century economy.
The gems and jewellery sector employs 4.6 million people.
One million of them work in the diamond industry alone.
Hence, the gems and jewellery sector is a prime example of the potential of 'Make in India' and 'Skill India'.
Today, we have ministers from several African countries.
In fact, we have vast experience and talent in design, but we are not up to the mark.
Not only this, hair dressers are also changing their client's hair style fashion.
We live in an age where diamonds are used in glasses, watches, and pens.
Once upon a time, India enjoyed a global reputation for manufacturing and exporting certain goods.
I hope the industry will continue to be in touch with the state governments.
Have the gems and jewellery industry set any goals for this milestone year?
If it would be in the best interest of our country, of course we would consider it.
