Over the past 20 years, more than 8,50,000 people have died in some kind of disaster in the Asia Pacific region.
Seven countries in the Asia Pacific region are among the top 10 countries in the world in terms of deaths from disasters.
It is really hard to see people suffering from disasters.
But I was inspired to see their courage, hard work and passion to come out of any situation and start anew.
In my experience, the more we trust in people's leadership, the better the outcome.
We need this kind of initiative and cooperation through policies and methods.
The five nations most affected by the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami have enacted new laws to manage disaster prevention.
In one or two days we will celebrate the first International Tsunami Awareness Day.
The same applies to improvements in hurricane forecasting.
In India, if we compare the impact of cyclones in 1999 and 2013, we can see the progress made.
Now the programme has gained global recognition and international recognition.
There are still many major challenges ahead of us.
If we do not manage growth effectively, both in terms of planning and implementation, the economic and human losses from disasters will be greater than ever.
In this regard, I would like to present to you ten strategic agendas to review our efforts to prevent disasters and reduce risk:
First, all areas of development process should follow the principles of disaster prevention.
In the next one to two decades, most of the new infrastructure in the world will be built in our region.
We need to ensure that it is built to the best available standards of disaster prevention and safety.
India will work with other partner countries and all parties involved should partner to promote a strong disaster prevention framework in the region or build a centre.
Currently, in most countries of the region, the access to insurance is limited to medium and high middle income groups.
Millions of people have come to the banking system with Jan Dhan Yojana.
The security insurance scheme provides insurance coverage to the millions who need it most.
They also have special abilities and insight.
Fourthly, investments should be made in technology that checks risk factors.
We have widely accepted standards and criteria for assessing the risk associated with natural disasters such as earthquakes.
As part of this network, different universities can conduct research in more than one discipline on disaster prevention issues that are most relevant to them.
Social media has changed the way we respond to disasters.
It enables disaster prevention agencies to operate more quickly, efficiently and more easily to connect citizens with authorities.
After disasters, victims use social media to help each other.
A specific action plan has to be developed and implemented at the local level.
For example, the local fire service will visit a school in their area every week and inform thousands of children over the course of a year about what to do when a fire strikes.
And finally, there is a need to establish broad coordination in international response to disaster prevention.
After disaster, disaster victims from all over the world receive a large amount of assistance.
All nations of the Asia-Pacific region should work together to advance our efforts to build a strong disaster response framework.
Regional and international cooperation is a major force in our efforts.
India hosted the first South Asian Annual Disaster Management Exercise (SAED) in November last year.
India will soon launch the South Asia satellite in the spirit of regional cooperation.
As we implement the Sendai Framework, we will welcome new opportunities for regional and international collaboration.
